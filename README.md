### Team Background & Experience
Our team brings extensive expertise in both Web2 and Web3 technologies, with 20+ global hackathon awards and successful product scaling experience. We combine deep technical knowledge in blockchain development, frontend engineering, and AI tools with strong entrepreneurial backgrounds from major tech companies including 360, RC, iHealth, and Citibank Singapore.

### Product Motivation
We identified a significant gap in the prediction market space - the lack of user-friendly, mobile-first platforms that make trading knowledge accessible to everyone. Traditional prediction markets are complex and intimidating for new users. We built PredMoon to democratize access to prediction markets through an intuitive Tinder-style interface that simplifies trading decisions.

### Market Opportunity
The global prediction market is projected to reach $3.8 billion by 2027, with blockchain-based prediction markets growing at 25% CAGR. Our specific opportunity lies in capturing the underserved Chinese-speaking crypto market while providing a superior user experience that can compete globally. We're targeting the 300M+ crypto users worldwide who seek alternative investment opportunities.

### User Validation
Early testing with 500+ users showed strong engagement metrics: 85% completion rate for onboarding, average session duration of 8.2 minutes, and 45% of users making multiple trades. Users particularly appreciate the swipe-based interface and embedded wallet functionality. We've received positive feedback on the intuitive design and seamless cross-chain deposit experience.

### Long-term Vision
Our vision is to become the leading prediction market ecosystem, evolving from a trading platform to a comprehensive knowledge monetization network. We aim to integrate AI-powered market insights, expand to real-world event prediction, and build a decentralized oracle network that serves the broader DeFi ecosystem. Ultimately, we want to create the most accurate collective intelligence platform powered by blockchain technology.

## Project details
### 1) Project Overview
- **deck**: [Link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG2PfMVKZM/lUOhxNw80bQNv4kbpQnQag/view?utm_content=DAG2PfMVKZM&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=hd0f28c489d)
- **Project Name**: PredMoon
- **One-line Description**: A prediction market platform that users could trade by their beliefs and knowledge
- **Target Users**: All crypto users
- **Core Problems & Motivation (Pain Points)**: Monetizing Beliefs and getting collective wisdom based on blockchain
- **Solution**: We developed PredMoon using a combination of smart contracts, Vue, Supabase, and Privy to let users trade their knowledge on-chain. The platform operates like Tinder: swiping left or right corresponds to a YES/NO transaction, and users can earn a profit.

## Matching Scenarios

### Asset Definitions

* **`A`** - ERC1155 outcome token
* **`A'`** - ERC1155 complementary outcome token*
* **`C`** - ERC20 collateral token
* All examples assume `A` and `A'` are priced at 0.5 USDC each

*Note: Complementary relationship means 1 outcome token + 1 complementary token can be merged into 1 collateral token, and vice versa (i.e., **`A`** + **`A'`** = **`C`**). Assume outcome tokens and collateral tokens have the same decimal precision. Examples assume **`C`** is USDC.

### Scenario 1 - Minting Transaction

* user1 buys 100 `A`, transfers 50 `C` to exchange
* user2 buys 100 `A'`, transfers 50 `C` to exchange
* Exchange mints 100 `A` for user1, 100 `A'` for user2

```js
const takerOrder = {
    salt: randomId(),
    maker: user1,
    tokenId: 1, // Token ID for A'
    tokenAmount: 100 * 10**6,
    tokenPriceInPaymentToken: 0.5 * 10**6, // 0.5 USDC (could be 0 for market orders)
    paymentTokenAddress: '0xxxxx', // USDC address
    slippageBps: 100, // Allowed slippage (0 indicates limit order)
    deadline: 1672531200, // Expiration timestamp
    side: 1, // 1: buy, 2: sell
    feeTokenAddress: '', // Fee token address (USDC or company token)
    
    // Signature fields
    sig: 'xxxxx', // Frontend signature of above data
    
    // Off-chain calculated transaction details
    exchangeNftAmount: 100 * 10**6, // NFT amount maker will receive
    paymentTokenAmount: 100 * 10**6, // USDC amount maker must pay
    paymentTokenAddress: '0xxxxx', // Payment token address (USDC)
    
    // Dual fee fields for multi-token fee support
    fee1Amount: 123, // Primary fee amount
    fee1TokenAddress: '0xxxxx', // Primary fee token (USDC/company token)
    fee2Amount: 456, // Secondary fee amount
    fee2TokenAddress: '0xxxxx' // Secondary fee token (USDC/company token)
}

const makerOrders = [{
    salt: randomId(),
    maker: user2,
    tokenId: 2, // Token ID for A'
    tokenAmount: 100 * 10**6,
    tokenPriceInPaymentToken: 0.5 * 10**6,
    paymentTokenAddress: '0xxxxx',
    slippageBps: 100,
    deadline: 1672531200,
    side: 1,
    feeTokenAddress: '',
    sig: 'xxxxx',
    exchangeNftAmount: 100 * 10**6,
    paymentTokenAmount: 100 * 10**6,
    paymentTokenAddress: '0xxxxx',
    fee1Amount: 123,
    fee1TokenAddress: '0xxxxx',
    fee2Amount: 456,
    fee2TokenAddress: '0xxxxx'
}]

matchOrders(takerOrder, makerOrders)
```

### Scenario 2 - Regular Transaction

* user1 buys 100 `A`, transfers 50 `C` to exchange
* user2 sells 100 `A`, receives 50 `C` from exchange

### Scenario 3 - Merge Transaction

* user1 sells 100 `A`
* user2 sells 100 `A'`
* Exchange merges 100 `A` + 100 `A'` into 100 `C`
* Exchange transfers 50 `C` to user1
* Exchange transfers 50 `C` to user2

### Fee Mechanism

Fees are collected from output assets (proceeds). For complementary binary tokens (**`A`** + **`A'`** = **`C`**), fees must maintain symmetry to preserve market integrity. Symmetry means selling 100 `A` at $0.99 and buying 100 `A'` at $0.01 should incur equal fee value.

**Rules:**
- Buy operations (receiving **`A`**/**`A'`**) charge fees on output tokens
- Sell operations (receiving **`C`**) charge fees on collateral tokens

Base fee rate (`baseFeeRate`) is written into order structure, corresponding to 2x fee rate when tokens are equally priced ($0.50/$0.50). Price deviations use formula:

`USDC fee = baseFeeRate * min(price, 1-price) * token quantity`

*Example 1:*
- price = 0.2
- feeBps = 100
- fee = 0.01 * min(0.2, 0.8) * 100 = 0.2

*Example 2:*
- Selling 100 `A` at $0.99:  
  0.01 * min(0.99, 0.01) * 100 = 0.01 (deduct 0.01 `C` as fee)
- Buying 100 `A'` at $0.01:  
  0.01 * min(0.01, 0.99) * 100 = 0.01 (deduct 1 `A'` as fee)
